			<p>	Justin and Nicole met in January of 2017 at the University of Chicago, where they were both working. Justin was leading John List's experimental team, and Nicole was creating curriculum for John and Steve Levitt's intro-level Econ class. Nicole and Justin thought their relationship was a secret for months, though apparently even John and Steve knew two weeks in... </p>

			<p> In the fall of 2017, Nicole started grad school at Northwestern and moved to Evanston. Throughout the year, Justin bought and delivered a year-long supply of frozen pizza so Nicole would never have to go without dinner during her grueling first-year-of-grad-school experience. The prioritized weekly date nights throughout the year, which made the two-hour "long distance" relationship much more pleasant. </p>

		<h3>
			Our Engagement Story - Nicole's Perspective
		</h3>

		<p> By the first week of September, Justin and I had been talking about getting engaged. We picked out a ring together and I knew it was in the works, but Justin assured me it had not yet been made. I made it super clear that I wanted to be surprised, but I also wanted to have my nails done, and although this sounds impossible, due to a combination of dress-up events and me being very gullible, Justin pulled it off.   </p>

		<p>	On Saturday, Justin convinece me I should get my nails done. If he was to make a surprise proprosal, I should get in the practice of doing my nails, so that they would always be done. Somehow I believed him that today's mainucure would just be a practice run (and would ensure I had nice looking nails for our conference later that week). Miraculously, I believed that he got a haircut for the same reason. Later that afternoon, Justin suggested we go for a date at the beach! We rode our bikes to North Ave Beach and arrived just in time to grab drinks before the sun set. Justin suggested we splurge on a flight of frozen drinks. I thought, "why not?" and still did not suspect a thing. </p>

		<p> Later that night, we walked along the pier, with the most beautiful view of Chicago! I suggested we head home for dinner, and Justin agreed. I was so confused when he kept stopping to say nice things! We had a dinner to eat! We talked about how the pier is my favorite place in all of Chicago, and with the words "I feel like I'm living my best life with you, and I want to keep living my best life with you," Justin got down on one knee! Talk about romantic!!! 
		</p>

		<p> We finished off the night with a surprise dinner reservation at The Little Goat (one of my favorite restaurants!!). I called my parents, who were in Missouri for my Aunt's birthday. I still remember the sound of everyone shreiking excitedly when we told them the news!
